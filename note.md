# Big O notation

- To analyze the performance of algorithm
- Measure time and space complexity

## Time Complexity

- Start time
- Run function
- End time
- Start time - End Time

---

- Count Operations
- Check N times or constant time in each of the operations

## Question 

- How many operations do you use in your function?

## Offical Big O

If input size (n) and run for loop with this n size 
- It is linear
- O(n)

Nested Loop
- O(n2)

Arithmatic Operation, Variable, Access element in array or object by key or index
- O(1)

## Space Complexity

- auxiliary space complexity
- Not measure input size and Measure data inside algorithm
- Primitives Type(Boolean, Numbers, Undefined, Null) are constant space **O(1)**
- Strings require **O(n)** space
- Arrays and Objects require **O(n)** space 

## Logarithms

- Logarithms time complexity is great!
